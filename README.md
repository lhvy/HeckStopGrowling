# HeckStopGrowling

Do you ever just want to play Minecraft with your friend but you're both so bad at aiming that you keep accidentally hitting each other and your pets get mad and start growling?

And then you've turned off PvP but now you keep hitting each other's pets and they continue to growl? ~~No~~ Yes? Well then this plugin is for you!

Simply install it, and all friendly fire towards tamed animals is entirely disabled. (Projectiles shot by players at tamed animals are also cancelled and cease to exist instead of bouncing back like when you shoot at an Enderman)
